          <h3>Web Platform for Learning Norwegian Language and Culture</h3>
          <p>
            Language learning is an ever-evolving field, driven by globalization
            and the demand for diverse linguistic skills. In this context,
            Norwegian stands out as a language of growing interest due to its
            professional relevance, connection to Norway—a prosperous country
            with a high quality of life—and its relation to other Scandinavian
            languages. However, learning Norwegian presents challenges,
            primarily due to the limited availability of educational resources
            compared to more popular languages like English or Spanish. Despite
            this, technology and digital tools are transforming education,
            providing global access to resources that allow people to learn
            languages at any time and from anywhere. This context motivated the
            development of an educational platform that facilitates self-paced
            learning and cultural immersion in the Norwegian language.
            <br />
            <br />
            The application is an interactive educational platform designed for
            learning the Norwegian language, allowing users to access a variety
            of resources in a flexible and personalized manner. Users, who can
            be students, teachers, or collaborators, can view educational
            resources such as lessons, daily words, and participate in virtual
            events related to Norwegian culture. They can also search for
            teachers, lessons, and events using specific filters, and explore
            posts in a culture and learning blog. Users also have the option to
            translate texts between various languages and access a virtual
            keyboard to facilitate writing in other languages. On the other
            hand, specific roles such as teachers have exclusive rights to
            create and manage educational content, such as the "Word of the Day"
            and Norwegian lessons. Collaborators, meanwhile, can manage cultural
            posts and events. The platform also allows users to manage their
            accounts, update personal information, and, if desired, delete their
            profiles. In summary, the application provides a comprehensive
            learning and cultural participation experience, with a focus on
            flexibility, accessibility, and content personalization.

          <p>
            In the development of this educational platform for learning
            Norwegian, a thorough market analysis was conducted, examining
            various similar language learning applications, both globally and
            specifically for Norwegian. This analysis allowed us to identify key
            features and functionalities offered by other platforms, as well as
            their strengths and areas for improvement. We also examined trends
            in digital education and the technologies used in the field, which
            helped us create an innovative and optimized solution for users
            interested in learning Norwegian effectively. To carry out this
            project, I specialized in Amazon Web Services (AWS), which allowed
            me to incorporate advanced cloud infrastructure tools like Amazon
            DynamoDB and Amazon S3, providing excellent scalability and
            performance for the system. My training in AWS was crucial in
            developing a robust and efficient platform capable of handling large
            numbers of users and multimedia resources securely and accessibly.
            <br />
            <br />
            The development process of the platform has been a continuous
            journey of learning and improvement. I started by defining key user
            needs, focusing on simplicity and accessibility in learning
            Norwegian. Over the course of the project, we designed and developed
            features such as lesson visualization, text translation, and
            interaction with cultural events, using modern tools like Node.js,
            Express, and Bootstrap for responsive design. AWS integration
            allowed efficient management of the database and cloud resources,
            ensuring optimal performance for the platform. This project is not
            just a technical creation; it is deeply tied to my passion for
            Norway. I have always been fascinated by the culture, language, and
            history of this beautiful country. In fact, the main reason I
            created this platform was to have a place where I could learn and
            immerse myself in the Norwegian language and culture in a more
            accessible and structured way. Learning Norwegian has always been a
            personal dream, and this application has allowed me to combine my
            passion with my goal of creating a useful tool for both myself and
            others who share this interest.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal is to continue improving the platform, adding more features
            that enrich the learning experience, and including more cultural and
            educational resources related to Norway. User feedback will be key
            to guiding future updates, and I plan to incorporate new
            technologies and expand the content offering so users can enjoy a
            more complete and personalized educational experience.{" "}

          <h3>iOS App for Professional Medical Use</h3>
          <p>
            Since the start of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19,
            technology has played a greater role today, transforming the way we
            interact with it. In the midst of this health crisis, we spend more
            time on mobile devices. According to a report by App Annie, the time
            spent on apps increased by 20% year-on-year during the first quarter
            of 2020, and consumer spending increased by 15% on iOS devices and
            5% for Android devices. Health professionals also had to adapt to
            new ways of interacting with technology to combine their training
            with long shifts at medical centers. This is why I considered that
            my greatest contribution with this final degree project was to
            create a platform where doctors could stay informed of the latest
            advances in medicine, interact with colleagues, and share
            experiences easily, all while having the app readily available. The
            day-to-day life of healthcare personnel is demanding, yet they
            continue to train, study the latest research, adopt new
            technologies, and much more. Medspace was born to create a solid
            "doctors for doctors" community to share knowledge, experiences, and
            advice. This platform aims to provide a space for medical
            professionals to stay informed and connected at all times.
            <br />
            <br />
            In a few words, the app enables doctors and an administrator to
            manage medical publications, including creating, editing,
            commenting, and searching for content, and the administrator creates
            news, while doctors create clinical cases, debates, and articles.
            Both roles can manage their accounts.
          </p>

          <div className="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/img/medspace-app.png" alt="Medspace App" />
          </div>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            The development of Medspace was carefully planned, starting with a
            market study and the creation of use case and class diagrams to
            ensure the platform would meet real needs in the medical field.
            Special attention was given to designing an elegant yet minimalistic
            user interface, keeping the experience clean and intuitive for busy
            healthcare professionals. Using Swift and Xcode for iOS development,
            combined with Firebase for real-time data management and secure
            authentication, the project focused not only on technical excellence
            but also on performance, usability, and privacy. Throughout the
            process, continuous testing and feedback allowed us to refine both
            functionality and design, resulting in a reliable and easy-to-use
            app that fits seamlessly into the daily routines of doctors.

            I’ve always been curious about the world of hybrid and
            cross-platform applications. That interest pushed me to start
            exploring mobile development on my own, and once I started learning
            Swift, I was fascinated by how quickly you can build something
            functional and meaningful. It felt very rewarding to see my ideas
            take shape in a real app. I found the field of medicine incredibly
            inspiring. It was important to me that this project have real value
            and utility—creating a tool that could potentially support
            healthcare professionals in their day-to-day lives felt like a small
            but meaningful way to contribute.
