          My name is Queralt Sosa Mompel. Welcome to my world. In few words I develop software.
          I’ve always been passionate about technology, especially programming.
          I get excited every time I code — it’s like I feel butterflies in my stomach.
          Programming is not just my profession; it’s something that makes me feel truly alive.
          Today, I’m a software engineer with a keen interest in learning new tools and improving my skills.
          I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and its potential to make a positive impact.
          I’m always open to new projects and enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to solve problems and contribute to meaningful work.
